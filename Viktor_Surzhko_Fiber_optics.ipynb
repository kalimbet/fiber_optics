    "# Fiber optics (optical fiber)\n",
    "Fiber optics, or optical fiber, refers to the medium and the technology associated with the transmission of information as light pulses along a glass or plastic strand or fiber. Fiber optics is used long-distance and high-performance data networking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiber optics are also commonly used in telecommunication services such as internet, television and telephones. As an example, companies such as Verizon and Google use fiber optics in their Verizon FIOS and Google Fiber services, providing gigabit internet speeds to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fiber optic cables are used since they hold a number of advantages over copper cables, such as higher bandwidth and transmit speeds\n",
    "\n",
    "A fiber optic cable can contain a varying number of these glass fibers -- from a few up to a couple hundred. Surrounding the glass fiber core is another glass layer called cladding. A layer known as a buffer tube protects the cladding, and a jacket layer acts as the final protective layer for the individual strand."
